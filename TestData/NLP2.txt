1. Defining the subject of linguistics.  Is language observable?  The stream of meanings and the stream of sounds.  Non-observability of meanings.  Language as a set of correlations between the two levels. 2. Morpheme as the shortest meaningful phonemic chain.  Lexical meanings vs. syntax meanings.  Are syntax meanings “real” meanings?  What happens if we don’t use syntax morphemes?  Grammatical correctness as the “protocol layer” of language. 
3. Inflectional morphology; lexemes and word forms; paradigms.  What alphabet to use in a dictionary?  Spelling, phonemic, and morphophonemic transcriptions.4. Stemming.  Why stemming is important in an inflected language.  Examples of Russian stemming algorithms.5. Advantages and drawbacks of dealing with inflection.  Morphology as a clue to the syntax structure.  Examples from the case theory.  Inflected languages vs. isolating languages.6. Morphemes that don’t belong to a paradigm.  Derivational morphology vs. inflectional morphology.

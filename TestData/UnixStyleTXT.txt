The Chaplain, Rev. James David Ford, D.D., offered the following prayer:
As we offer our prayers of thanksgiving and recall how we have been blessed, we remember, O God, those who do not know the gifts of life, who suffer from hunger, those who are living in alienation and do not know the security of love and affection and care. We recall too those who live with the pain of war and those who are abused and who suffer. Gracious God of mercy and peace, bless all Your people who are in great need and teach us to use our resources and energies to heal the wounds of people everywhere and so do Your gracious will. In Your name we pray. Amen.

(Mr. GEJDENSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. GEJDENSON. Mr. Speaker, the President's package is in gridlock. Thankfully, it is not in this body at the moment, but I think there is a lesson for all of us to learn.
As we look at reforming the Congress, we do not want to create a system where a small minority can stop a program from coming to fruition. What we want to see is a Congress that works together, that passes this economic stimulus package, that helps bring the American economy back.
Gridlock should have ended this last November. The country spoke to elect a Democratic Congress and a Democratic Senate. What is happening today as the President's program languishes, even without a time limit to end debate, is unacceptable. Bring the President's package to a vote. Let the Congress vote and let us send it to the President for his signature.

<TEXT>

(Mr. HUFFINGTON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)
Mr. HUFFINGTON. Mr. Speaker, no judgment passed on American Government is more consistent, more painful, or more accurate than this: Those entrusted with the national checkbook have broken their pledge to balance it.
Overspending has hurt us. Misplaced priorities and a remarkable act of juggling of figures--these have done damage too.
As a candidate, I championed fiscal restraint and Government accountability. To cut the deficit and balance the budget, both are needed. But, as a businessman, I know they are not enough. They do not make the system manageable. To do that, someone must take final responsibility for honest bookkeeping and commonsense balances.
My record demonstrates how little confidence I have in the current administration's desire or ability to balance the budget. But no President can be held accountable for managing wisely unless he has the ability to say `no' to specific expenditures. The buck needs to stop somewhere and I think Harry Truman identified the right spot.
I may not like how the President and his advisers wield the tool I wish to give them. But I cannot demand that the President be held accountable and deny him the tool of accountability. Therefore, I will support the freshmen-sponsored line-item veto.

(Mr. VISCLOSKY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, Bill Clinton was elected President to fix our economy and put Americans back to work making a decent wage.
I am proud that the House--again--endorsed the President's plan.
Yesterday, we joined with the President to move our economy forward in a fiscally responsible fashion.
The plan reduces the deficit by $496 billion over 5 years and carefully shifts the priorities of our Nation away from consumption to investment.
By focusing on investment, the President's plan ensures that more resources will be available for our children and grandchildren.
President Clinton has given our Nation a solid plan. Our action yesterday was a step in the right direction.
We must now remain committed to change the economy and secure the brightest future for ourselves and our children.

(Mr. GOODLATTE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, many career politicians spend their whole adult lives in elective office. They have never run a private business, met payrolls, dealt with Government redtape and had to survive out in the real world.
That is one reason I'm cosponsoring House Joint Resolution 38, a constitutional amendment limiting Members of Congress to 12 years--six 2-year terms for Representatives and two 6-year terms for Senators.
Term limits will force Members of Congress to return home and live under the laws they impose on the rest of our citizens instead of exempting themselves from complying with so many laws as they do in Congress today. This will cause legislators to write laws with a sharper pencil.
In addition, term limits will help change the way this institution operates rewarding merit rather than longevity and ability rather than incumbency. We need real change and term limits are a solid step in reforming the way business is done in Washington.

<TEXT>

(Mr. PRICE of North Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, yesterday's vote on the President's budget proposal shows that the gridlock finally is breaking. Never before has the budget received final approval in the House prior to May 13, and usually it has been much later than that. We have taken quick, decisive, and effective action 6 weeks ahead of schedule to cut spending, reduce the Federal budget deficit, restore fairness to the Tax Code, and make investments critical for our Nation's economic future.
Now the next step is to take equally quick and decisive action on the supplemental appropriation bill, the President's economic stimulus and investment package now awaiting action in the Senate. This bill is a down payment on these long-term investments on our Nation's economic strength and global competitiveness. It is an insurance policy against a reversal of the modest gains the economy has made, and it is a boost toward real economic recovery.
So Mr. Speaker, before we return to our districts and our constituents, we must finish work on this supplemental appropriation bill, without which the budget package we passed yesterday is not complete. We must assure the American people that the gridlock really is breaking, and that we are determined to work cooperatively for the common good.

<TTL>LEGISLATION TO HELP OUR FARMERS AND OUR ENVIRONMENT (House - April 01, 1993)</TTL>
<DATE>19930401</DATE>
<FLD003>H</FLD003> 
<TEXT>

(Mr. ROBERTS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. Speaker, in behalf of my colleagues, Mr. Barrett of Nebraska, Mr. Smith of Oregon, and Mr. Allard, all members of the House Agriculture Committee, I am introducing legislation designed to help farmers and our environment.
President Clinton, in his budget plan, severely cuts farm programs by reducing the amount of acreage eligible for payment. But, there is no corresponding proposal to reduce the paperwork burden, the costs, and all of the mandates we have placed on farmers since conservation compliance came into being back in 1985.
This legislation establishes a simple principle, when we force farmers out of the farm program we also forfeit the right to tell the farmer how to farm. The current policy of reducing farm programs and increasing mandates is a collision course. Farmers will simply opt out of the farm program and with the likelihood conservation compliance will suffer and so will our Nation's effort to protect our soil and water resources.
I urge my colleagues' support of this bill.

Mr. TRAFICANT. Mr. Speaker, Frank Lorenzo, the man who never met an airline he could not bankrupt, wants back into the airline business. This is no April Fools' joke.
Lorenzo is the guy that bankrupted New York Air, Texas Air, Eastern Air, Texas International, Continental Air. But Lorenzo says not this time. He says his company, Friendship Airlines, is going to be lean and mean with only two aircraft.
I predict the first will be the Wright Brothers' plane that they flew at Kitty Hawk and the second will be a hot air balloon that was flown over Disney World.
Folks, Friendship Airlines my eye. How about the Enola Gay to Destroy American Airline Workers, Inc.?
I think the Department of Transportation should tell Mr. Lorenzo that they are all overbooked.

(Mr. BARRETT of Nebraska asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. BARRETT of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as an original cosponsor of Mr. Robert's legislation, to exempt farmer's triple base acres from the highly erodible land and wetland conservation requirements.
As the gentleman from Kansas has pointed out, during the 1990 Budget Reconciliation Act, farmers were told that they don't receive deficiency payments on 15 percent of their crop acreage. Consequently, as Congress reduced producers' returns and incentives, Congress did not reduce the requirement to adhere to the very costly conservation and environmental restrictions.
Now, this administration has proposed increasing the triple base requirement from 15 to 25 percent, without any regulatory relief. The Government can't have its cake and eat it too. This bill says that a farmer's unpaid acres will no longer be subject to the conservation compliance and wetlands protection requirements under current law.
Mr. Speaker, it is a two-way street. If the Government is set on withdrawing farm benefits, then the Government must remove the burdens that have accompanied these benefits in the past. I urge my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this reform legislation.

<TTL>THE 125TH ANNIVERSARY OF HAMPTON UNIVERSITY (House - April 01, 1993)</TTL>
<DATE>19930401</DATE>
<FLD003>H</FLD003> 
<TEXT>

(Mr. SCOTT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. SCOTT. Mr. Speaker, I come before you today in praise of the 125th anniversary of Hampton University. Hampton University, is one of the oldest historically black universities in the country and one of the Nation's most prestigious centers of higher learning.
Following the end of the Civil War and the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation, the U.S. Freedman's Bureau issued a nationwide call for assistance in helping the thousands of freed blacks adjust to the changes in their lives. Brig. Gen. Samuel Chapman Armstrong responded to that call, by purchasing a farm on Hampton Creek and establishing what was then known as the Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute.
From the somewhat modest beginning of 15 students, Hampton has grown to a student body of 5,700 with 23 percent of the graduating class going on to graduate school and over 60 percent going directly into positions relating to their majors. In fact, there is a waiting list for corporations who wish to recruit students from Hampton.
It is with pride that on the occasion of Hampton's 125th anniversary that we pay tribute to the founders of this great university, to Dr. William Harvey, Hampton's current president, to the scholars who serve on the faculty and to the outstanding student body.

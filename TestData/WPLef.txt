PHASE I - WORK PLANn                                                                                                                                                                                      
The 
 goal of Phase I research is to test our baseline      assumption using  a formal theory of human cognition that have already yielded very promising results in the studies of conflict, reflexive control, and military planning. This pioneering theory was developed primarily by Vladimir A. Lefebvre (Lefebvre 1967, 1982, 1998, 2001). Lefebvre proceeds from several intuitively obvious assumptions, such as 
(1) Behavior of individuals and organizations is often motivated by factors other than utility.
(2) These factors (which Lefebvre calls deontological) are related to the human ability to perceive and evaluate oneself and others. Deontological factors are influenced by the pressure of the social environment, as well as by individual's intentions and self-perception.
(3) Humans are capable of making automatic (unconscious, algorithmic) evaluations of themselves, people, objects, and actions as well as others perceptions of themselves as "good" or "bad" (or perhaps as being "better" or "worse" than other ones).
(4) Humans strive to achieve the highest possible measure of such evaluation.

To develop a formal model of this automatic ethical reasoning, Lefebvre applies a modified version of the Boolean algebra where the traditional logical interpretations of the two values are replaced with an ethical interpretation (i.e. 'good' and 'evil' instead of 'true' and 'false'). Building on the standard Boolean formalism and several intuitive postulates, Lefebvre develops a simple but powerful formal mechanism enabling a researcher to define and measure factors that determine moral choice. Applying this formalism to human interaction, Lefebvre shows that there are exactly two non-contradictory ways of evaluating social behavior based on the ethical values assigned to specific Boolean operations. A formal operation called combination of good and evil can be evaluated either negatively (the first ethical system) or positively (second ethical system). A formal analysis of these two systems leads to the conclusion that in the first system, where the behavior that involves a compromise between good and evil is evaluated negatively, an individual seeking a compromise with other individuals (as opposed to a compromise with the evil in individual's own behavior) has a higher status than a person who is choosing confrontation with others. In the second system, a higher status is attained by those who choose confrontation, while a compromise with individual's own bad behavior is acceptable. Little is known about how an organization chooses one of the two ethical systems but once a choice has been made, the cognitive process that calculates such parameters is automatic.
Expanding the Boolean formalism, Lefebvre develops a generalized version of the game theory that combines both the utilitarian measure and the status of the players based on non-utilitarian (deontological) value of the strategies available to a player. For example, in the case of an individual who needs to choose between a high payoff compromise and a continuation of violent struggle with a low payoff, the choice will be influenced by the ethical system used by the organization to evaluate the alternatives. If the value system of the organization is based on the second ethical system (as is often the case) the choice of a compromise will be automatically judged as "evil". A militant striving to achieve a hero's status will proudly reject compromise, treating the peaceful alternative as a coward's choice. A pragmatic leader may choose a peaceful solution but will be aware of his own low status and of other members' contempt for such leader and the choices he makes. (The expanded Boolean formalism allows Lefebvre to represent the payoff matrix as a system of linear equations whose solutions yield a specific measure of XXXX which can be interpreted as XXXX).
Only a formal model that includes the notion of a moral choice can explain the seemingly irrational strategies of militant groups while the metrics introduced by Lefebvre provides an exact measure of this "irrationality". To the best of our knowledge, Lefebvre's theory of moral cognition is the only formal model that possesses such capabilities. Let us emphasize that since the measures of the individuals' status are determined by an automatic procedure, a sort of a "mental computer", one does not need to explicate the reasons behind certain choices. This explains, by the way, why some terrorist organizations fail to provide any consistent rationale for their actions.
Among the features of the theory that are of primary importance for this proposal are: a classification of organizations based on the two ethical systems; a classification of leaders and members based on the ethical system used by the organization to evaluate the behavior of its members; the expanded Boolean formalism allowing to calculate status of an individual, and the generalized game theory.
We believe that the theory of moral cognition with its classification of social environments, a set of behavioral models and strategies, such as the generalized and a well-developed formalism is ideal for the task of modeling human organizational behavior in the OOTW context.

Phase I individual tasks are structured to prove the viability of our approach to CLIR for a single language pair.

Task 1 - Identify the sources of data for evaluating the moral cognition model.
Cognitive sciences have no means of direct instrumental observation. Therefore the source data needed to construct models of human behavior usually come from indirect means, such as self-observations, experts' opinions, conversations, opinion polls, or documents. Our focus here will be on selecting the sources of information about a variety of foreign and domestic organizations that will minimize the possibility of observer's influence on the way this information is used to construct a formal model of organizational behavior.
The use of expert opinions seems to be the worst of the choices since they are themselves products of analysis which is mostly based on personal opinion, cannot be reproduced by a non-expert or expressed as an algorithmic process and therefore defies the purpose of formal modeling. Lefebvre often relies on the analysis of narratives describing various activities of a specific organization and its leaders. This approach requires a translation of a natural language text into a formalized representation of the organization and its members using a language of formulae. Since no machine translation system exists that could automate this process, we have to rely on human interpretation, which of course may be tainted by translator's personal view of the matter. 
As an alternative, one can also utilize results of opinion polls, referenda, or questionnaires specifically developed for such studies (Lefebvre &&&&). However, using non-narrative sources of raw data may limit the research since all such means of discovery are focused on pre-determined aspects of organizational structure and the personalities of its members and may therefore miss important features that were previously unknown. In other words, despite being the most challenging way of extracting formal structures of human cognition, natural language documents remain the most promising ones.
The focus of this task will be first on identifying the organizations that are both important in OOTW context, represent differing cultural and ethical features, and have a sufficient document trail. Secondly, we will obtain a selection of various documents related to the activity of the selected organizations. The foreign language texts will be translated into English by the team of Universal Dialog's expert translators. In selecting the most promising sources of raw data we will specifically look for the following genres:

Normative texts. Organizations tend to explicate their values producing all sorts of normative documents ranging from manifestos to codified norms of conduct sometimes spelling out a measure of punishment for transgressions and the rewards given for exemplary behavior.

Third party reports. Such documents, often coming from observers who belong to different cultures and ethical systems are quite valuable since they do not intentionally focus on specific parameters of organizational structure and behavior eliminating the risk of observers imposing their pre-conceived views on how an organization should functions and subconsciously hiding the facts that may contradict the chosen model.

Confrontational statements. Organizations are often concerned with perceived inaccuracies in the way they are portrait by outside observes, often embarking on propaganda offensives to dispute them making public statements and engaging in confrontations that often result in peculiar communicative failures. For example, a Jordanian poet recently interviewed by a Western journalist had expressed pride that a videotape released by the U.S. Government showed Osama bin Laden quoting his poem stating at the same time that the tape was a CIA fabrication. Such behavior, bizarre as it may seem to a rational Western observer is common in some societies and is often induced through specialized training aided by normative documents.

Internet discussions The impact made by the emergence of network communication on human ability to perceive and interpret the way they are viewed by members of other cultural and ethnic groups is enormous. As recently as ten years ago, contacts between members of organizations with sharply differing values were limited to diplomacy, propagandistic materials, and infrequent citizens exchanges where free flow of information was often impeded by diplomatic protocol, linguistic problems, and limited duration of such contacts. While all this has radically changed since access to Internet discussion groups became available to most Westerners and to many educated people in the Third Worlds and the former communist countries, this new ability to communicate did not seem to improve understanding between the members of organizations with opposing value systems. Given the fact that the masterminds of the recent terror attacks were computer literate and availed themselves to Internet use, it is very important to analyze the statements made by adherents of certain radical groups in public discussions and to see if a formal model of their stated vision of the world can help enable an analyst to determine their behavior.

Task deliverables. 
Identify several organizations spanning a variety of cultures, value systems, and stated goals. Build a corpus of natural language documents related to their activities and produce accurate English translations. Evaluate the possibility of using non-narrative source such as opinion polls and questionnaires. 

Task 2 - Develop manual procedures for extracting relevant information from a narrative. Explore the possibility of using natural language processing software for automatic creation of formal models of organizational behavior.

Here we are concerned with ensuring that the procedures used to extract modeling data from the source texts are reliable and not affected by the personalities of those who perform such extraction. The focus of this task will be on developing simple procedures that will allow acquisition of relevant data from natural language texts and other possible sources. With goal of Phases II and III in mind, these manual procedures need to be understandable for the end users, such as diplomats, intelligence analysts, and law enforcement personnel who may not be familiar with the intricacies of the base theory. This can be achieved by asking a set of simple questions, for example, "Does this text contain information about the subject's view of himself?" "Is this view positive or negative?" "Do you think that the subject has an accurate view of himself?" "Do you think the subject has an accurate view of the goals of his organization?" The end-user must understand that it is possible for a document to contain no answers to some or all of these questions.

Additionally, one may consider a possibility of using natural language processing software to perform the translations. This approach will eliminate the risk of contamination discussed in the previous task and will ensure replicability of results. However this task is by no means trivial. Existing NLP applications tend to utilize probabilistic approach, which is useful for identifying keyword frequencies (for example words whose meanings imply a threat) but are not very successful in identifying and disambiguating meanings. Fortunately UniversalDialog has acquired exclusive rights to a very advanced natural language processing system developed in Russia. Known by its Russian acronym ETAP, this NLP application has demonstrated its superb capabilities in machine translation and may in fact be applied to obtaining English translations of source documents. The main focus of this task however will be on partial automatic extraction of the formal semantics contained in source documents. Additionally, an ETAP-based linguistic parser can be utilized to extract semantic invariants of normative statements. Finally we will consider the use of reverse translations: producing verbal equivalents of symbolic formal representations used by the base model, which will enable intelligence analysts to use them without a specialized training.

Furthermore, a lexical analysis can be effectively used to identify cultural, ethnic, and ethical features of a document's author, even if it was written in or translated into English. For example, all cultures and ethical systems have norms that mandate avoidance of certain words or the use of euphemisms where other cultures see such restrictions s bizarre. For example, some religious traditions prohibit the use of God's name (this prohibition may be absolute or limited to specific contexts), Western standards of political correctness virtually prohibit the use of the words deemed offensive to minorities, while totalitarian societies taboo the use of words that can imply a positive image of an enemy (for example the ban on the use of the word "Israel" in some Arab countries, sine it may perceivably imply the acknowledgement of its right to exist) or the ban on the collocation "American democracy" in the former Soviet Union. Since the use of such concept is unavoidable, the organizations affected by such restrictions resort to the use of euphemisms such as "Zionist entity" in the case of the former or adding "so-called" to the latter.

Task deliverables. 
Develop manual procedures and training materials allowing extraction of the data relevant for the formal modeling of human organizational behavior. Evaluate the NLP methodologies that ay be used to partially automate that procedure.


Task 3 - Identify the formal means most suitable for the development of scenarios (programs) of decision-making based on strategic semantics extracted from input data.
The base theory offers a wealth of formal models that can be used to describe and in some cases predict behavior of individuals. We are particularly interested in the generalized game theory, the Boolean model of moral choice, and in an expanded Boolean model where the binary set of values is substituted with continuous parameters, which take on real values in the [0, 1] segment.


Task deliverables.
Identify a family of models best suitable for enumerating programs of subjects' behavior in situations requiring between two alternatives.

Task 4 - Prototype generalized strategies for mission planning, rehearsal, and personnel training in OOTW.

This task will largely depend on the outcome of the tasks 1 and 3. A very preliminary outline of a conflict elimination procedure may look as shown below:

* Acquire relevant intelligence data using the static database (see Task 1) and recent information. Identify the key players.
* Identify the ethical system(s) of the interacting organizations.
* Identify value assigned to the relevant parameters by the culture.

Let us emphasize the important distinction between ethical systems and ethical values. The former establishes correlations between ethical choices made by an individual. The latter determines, which choices should be viewed as 'good' or 'evil'. While the first ethical system is usually associated with peaceful democracies and the second one - with totalitarian violence, one should not commit the error of viewing organizations relying on the first system as 'good' and the other as 'evil'. A criminal gang may be following the first ethical system for example by stating that its members should avoid unnecessary violence and promoting those who steals or robs without harming people - but its values will be radically different from those of the law-abiding citizens. A heroic dissident who shares the democratic values of the West may reject a request to for talks with a repressive government citing his disgust for the same.
* Build personal profiles of the key players using information obtained in steps 1, 2, and 3.
* Examine the situation and identify utilitarian payoffs.
* Apply the appropriate formal model(s) in order to prototype possible scenarios and individual choices that may be made by the key players.
* Identify the most serious threats. Utilize the continuous model (XXXX) to determine the parameters that may induce highly volatile behavior in key players. Determine strategies that would defuse the threats by either blocking/countering the negative inputs or changing players' perception.
* Eliminate the conflict by controlling players' self-evaluation models in a way that will enhance their status by choosing compromising behavior.

Task deliverables.
Prototype strategies for interaction.

Furthermore, a lexical analysis can be effectively used to identify cultural, ethnic, and ethical features of a document's author, even if it was written in or translated into English. For example, all cultures and ethical systems have norms that mandate avoidance of certain words or the use of euphemisms where other cultures see such restrictions as bizarre. For example, some religious traditions prohibit the use of God's name (this prohibition may be absolute or limited to specific contexts), Western standards of political correctness virtually prohibit the use of the words deemed offensive to minorities, while totalitarian societies taboo the use of words that can imply a positive image of an enemy (for example the ban on the use of the word "Israel" in some Arab countries, sine it may perceivably imply the acknowledgement of its right to exist) or the ban on the collocation "American democracy" in the former Soviet Union. Since the use of such concept is unavoidable, the organizations affected by such restrictions resort to the use of euphemisms such as "Zionist entity" in the case of the former or adding "so-called" to the latter.

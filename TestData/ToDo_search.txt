1. When switching simple to boolean either clean search combo or copy contents to enter term combo
2. Boolean search checkbox / "b" key??
3. Single term in boolean search -- treat as simple search
4. Investigate multiple words as single term (remove "words" option??)
5. Change in text --> change in context
6. Select all words in context window after user pressed "next"
7. Disable static stuff after Boolean -> simple
8. History combo for Boolean

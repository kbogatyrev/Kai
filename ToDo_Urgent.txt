========== BUGS =========
46. Import text file, save as..., then close -- will be prompted to save again.
45. Right border move should not reposition caret.
44. [*** done] Make the width of the doc window less than line width, horiz. scroll to far right,
    click and hold mouse on the down or up button of the vert scroll bar; part of the
    screen is not repainted correctly.ii
43. [*** done] Reset $ no. and line no. in display window whenever there is a chance that the number of
    preceding lines had changed.
42. [*** done] Undo paragraph formatting.
41. Sometimes tracking line remains onscreen while the right border does not move.
40. Entering diacritics over space repositions caret incorrectly.
39. Verify all text changes set dirty flag.
38. TextPos Validate() must throw exceptions.
37. [*** done] Titles vanish after undo.
36. [*** done] Caret not repositioned after right border move.
35. Right border sometimes does not move after left button release; dashed line remains on screen.
34. No caret move after reformatting (long?) $.
33. [*** done] Crash while undoing very long lokens separated with punctuation (?)
32. [*** done or can't repro] Left field in installed version.
31. [*** can't repro] Enter text, hit Enter, then add a few more letters, insert diacritic; caret will jump to 
    the left border
30. In OVR mode, select a character, change font style, cancel selection, type over modified font, 
    then undo; modified font will not be restored.
29. Caret repositioning in OVR mode.
28. Hitting ESC must undo incomplete command, e.g., Alt+D, then ESC removes request to insert diactiric
27. [*** done] Select text segment, change font; with caret at font boundary, change font and insert 
    a character. Kai will hang or crash.
26. [*** can't repro] Insert character to the left of font boundary, then undo; the right char. will vanish.
25. Implement shift/control

23. [*** done] Document name in child window after a few changes/undo's.
22. [?] Left margin not repainted.
21. Try to move right border to the right of the narrowest position.

11. [*** done] "Save ???" dialog -- remove "*".
12. Change extension when saving txt files as kai files; if a file with .kai extension does 
    not check out as kai-format file, ask user if he wants to treat it as a text file.
[*** done] Insert char before a char with a diacritic
[*** done] Undo multi $$$ delete
2. 1st line in NLP.kai

5. If total num of lines < screen height, make sure 1st line is visible
6. Negative scroll offset
7. Open BoolTest, move caret to end, hit enter, try to move caret down
